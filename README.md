## Getting started
[See the wiki getting started for detailed set up.](https://github.com/bl3rune/Blu3Prints-Plugin/wiki/Getting-Started)

First start by crafting a Blu3print Writer in the crafting table using these materials in any configuration:

PAPER, LAPIS_LAZULI, FEATHER

While holding a Blu3print Writer, you can interact by:
- Using left click on a block to set the first position of the selection area (this clears the ignore list if there is one)
- Using left click (while sneaking) on a block to ignore/unignore the block within a selection
- Using right click on a block to set the second position of the selection area (this clears the ignore list if there is one)
- Using right click (while sneaking) on a block to show the ignore block list within the current selection
- Using right click on the air to set open the blu3print writer

With the blu3print writer open:
- Click on sign and give the blu3print a name to complete it
- Or instead of using area selection, enter a blu3print code on the pages of the book and then sign and complete

While holding a completed Blu3print, you can interact by:
- Using left click on a block to build the blu3print on top of that block
- Using right click on the air to print an explanation of the blu3print to chat like below
- Using right click on a block to place a holographic preview


### Exporting & Importing
------
[See the wiki sharing Blu3prints pages for how to get set up.](https://github.com/bl3rune/Blu3Prints-Plugin/wiki/Sharing-Blu3prints-and-using-between-servers)

Blu3prints can be exported by using a cartography table or by using the `blu3print.export` command whilst holding the blu3print item.
![Export](https://github.com/bl3rune/Blu3Prints-Plugin/raw/main/images/Export.png "Export")
This code can be shared to other players and even be used on other servers running this plugin, allowing you to preserve your creations across servers or even showcase them online (visualiser website in the pipeline!)
To use the encoded blu3prints, simply run the command `/blu3print.import <name> <encoded-string>`


## Permissions
By default all commands apart from `/blu3print.give` should be available for all non OP players.
There are also a default restrictions on the maximum size/scale of a blu3print for safety reasons. This can be configured in the `config.yml` file.
